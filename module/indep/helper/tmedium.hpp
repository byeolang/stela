     *  @brief Medium class used exclusively in the OR macro for safe reference handling
     *  @details The medium class is only used in the OR macro:
     *  one of the characteristics of the OR macro is that the final return value can be
     *  received as a reference. the fact that the final output type of this OR macro is always
     *  a reference type suggests that there is a logic to convert nullptr to a null reference
     *  and return it in the middle, even if the rhs entered into the OR macro is nullptr.
     *  sometimes, there are cases where you need to immediately wrap the T& returned by the OR
     *  macro with another container or wrapper class that can receive it. for example,
     *
     *  @code
     *  A& got = makeAOnHeap() OR.ret();
     *  // since this `got` variable is on the heap, we will use tstr to easily manage
     *  memory. tstr<A> gotLife(got);
     *  @endcode
     *
     *  if you don't want to create two variables like above, you may want to do this:
     *
     *  @code
     *  str wrap = getA() OR.ret();
     *  @endcode
     *
     *  but, there is one problem in this way.
     *  the c++ standard does not specify that the address value of a null reference is null.
     *  (and in fact, in an environment where optimized code is eval by clang on silicon macOS,
     *  referencing the address value of a nulled reference returns a garbage value.)
     *  so, when a null reference is received in the constructor of the tstr class, there is no
     *  way for the tstr class to determine whether it is correct or not.
     *
     *  then you might be thinking, `Why not just make the OR macro return a T*?`.
     *  if it returns T*, the meaning of using OR macro is greatly diminished.
     *  because users can no longer change from unsafe type to safe type easily, they might need
     *  to use some sort of c-style casting.
     *
     *  that's where `tmedium` class comes in. `tmedium` has the following purposes:
     *
     *  1. it should be very lightweight.
     *  2. it should have T* inside, but act like T& outside.
     *  3. it should be able to determine whether it is a valid T& or not from outside
     *  through tmedium.
