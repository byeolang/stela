/** @ingroup indep
 *  @brief byeolMeta macro's sub-commands, DEF_ME
 *  @details Similar to ME, this macro adds typedefs called `me` and `super` to the scope
 *  of the current compilation unit.
 *
 *  This macro was added for use when writing implementation files.
 *  Because the `ME` sub-command adds typedefs to the class scope, it's not available
 *  for you to access them outside of member fuctions when writing implementation file.
 *
 *  let me give you example:
 *  @code
 *      // Foo.cpp --
 *
 *      BY(DEF_ME(Foo))
 *      // From now on, new typedef `me` refers To Foo type, and `super` refers
 *      // to Foo::super.
 *      // if there's no Foo::super, you'll have some compile errors when use it.
 *
 *      me::Foo() {
 *          // if you didn't use DEF_ME above, `me::Foo() {` wouldn't be possible.
 *          // Instead, you should use `Foo::Foo() {` 'cause by the time use `me::`,
 *          // it's not in a member funtion.
 *      }
 *  @endcode
