    /** @ingroup memlite
     *  @brief Base class for all managed instances in memlite system
     *  @details Objects managed by memlite's custom memory pool must inherit from instance.
     *  Only by inheriting instance can objects be referenced through @ref binder as weak
     *  or strong pointers. Instances are identified through @ref id.
     *
     *  @section id_assignment_algorithm ID assignment algorithm
     *  The weakest part of memlite is this id assignment algorithm. Instance creation is
     *  done by @ref instancer which manages the memory pool. The instancer pushes the
     *  instance address and id to a map in the internal vault class. When
     *  instance::operator new() is called, it internally accesses vault using code like
     *  `map[this]` to retrieve the id value.
     *
     *  While seemingly fine, it has many disadvantages:
     *  1. Accessing vault during constructor phase is not truly safe
     *  2. It's slow
     *
     *  The initial implementation used only vector managed as FIFO, but when creating other
     *  objects inside a constructor, the order of added ids no longer follows FIFO,
     *  causing ID混乱 issues.
     *
     *  @remark Performance importance
     *  The most frequent operation in byeol is creating objects while assigning ids or
     *  performing binding. This needs improvement when time permits.
