     *  @brief Collection of memory chunks for scalable allocation
     *  @details Manages multiple @ref chunk instances. Since chunk uses only fixed-size
     *  memory created at initialization, chunks adds/removes multiple chunks to manage
     *  memory dynamically.
     *
     *  @section fixed_memory_only chunks also provides only fixed memory
     *  Since chunks adds or removes chunks, and each chunk cell uses only fixed size,
     *  chunks can also only allocate fixed-size memory.
     *
     *  @section pool_coordination Coordination with pool
     *  The first to receive memory requests is @ref pool class. When pool receives a memory
     *  size to allocate, it lazily retrieves a chunks instance capable of handling that
     *  memory size and requests new1(). chunks::new1() finds a chunk capable of allocating
     *  memory, and if none exists, creates an additional chunk.
     *
     *  @section chunk_search_algorithm Available chunk search algorithm
     *  The most recently memory-allocated chunk has the highest probability of being able
     *  to allocate additionally. Member variable `_s` holds the index of the most recently
     *  allocated chunk. If _chunks[_s] has no available memory, increment _s. Like a
     *  circular array, _chunks' end connects to its beginning. If _s loops back to its
     *  pre-traversal value and still no available memory exists, the entire chunks has no
     *  available memory, so enters resize().
     *
     *  @remark Cannot use vector
     *  Obviously, vector is managed on heap, so shouldn't use vector while making a custom
     *  memory pool. Planned for future modification.
