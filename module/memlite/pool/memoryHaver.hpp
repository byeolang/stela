     *  @brief Abstract interface for objects that own memory
     *  @details Base interface for classes that directly or indirectly own memory in the
     *  memory pool and can READ that memory. Defines interfaces for querying memory size
     *  and state.
     *
     *  @section indirect_ownership Indirect ownership?
     *  "Indirect ownership" means the object doesn't directly allocate and use memory, but
     *  internal member variables handle it. If memory allocation must be done through
     *  internal members, the class should only inherit memoryHaver. If allocation is also
     *  possible, inherit @ref allocator.
     *
     *  @section len_and_size len and size
     *  Allocatable memory size is expressed as size, while allocated memory is expressed
     *  as len. Control is based solely on void* and byte units.
     *
     *  @remark memoryHaver derivatives manage different memory sizes
     *  Note that memoryHaver derived classes each manage different sizes of memory.
